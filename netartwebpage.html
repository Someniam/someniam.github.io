<p style="color:white;">I created a digital scavenger hunt to find a special link to something that means a lot to me! I wanted to share with people a cartoon that I think has a lot of promise! The scavenger hunt is themed around characters from that cartoon, as well as various other elements of science fiction pop-culture like Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes and Buzz Lightyear. I wanted to include various other sci-fi properties like Red Dwarf, Battlestar Galactica, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Starjammers from Marvel Comics, and Doctor Who, but I couldn't figure out how to incorporate them into the scavenger hunt story. The goal of the scavenger hunt is to find a special star. It's hidden somewhere in the universe. I hope you can find the star! </p>
<p style="color:white;">Click on the star to visit my net art!</p>
