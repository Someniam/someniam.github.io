<p> Hello. My name is Puck Reverie. I am currently a student at San Jose State University and this is my artist statement for 2025. I am currently applying for my Digital Media Art degree and have revised my portfolio a bit to better match the requirements. Now on to my artist statement. 
<br>
I am an artist who is interested in doing digital art, particularly animation. I originally applied for the animation program at SJSU, but I didn’t get accepted. Nevertheless, I’m continuing with my art making journey and have continued with the Digital Media Art major. My art making journey began when I was a toddler and has continued over the last 17 or so years as of October 2025. I remember once I won an award for my art piece of the solar system that I had made in kindergarten. I used to draw a LOT of space related stuff. Originally, I wanted to become an astronomer, but eventually I started gaining a much larger interest in pursuing a career in the arts. Although my interest in astronomy has waned, it has never completely died out, which is why I still have a big interest in anything sci-fi and space related. I first started getting serious about my art career in 2021, when a representative from the Academy of Art University came to talk to my art class about what careers one could pursue with an art degree. That was when I decided to shift my focus from astronomy to art school. What I wanted was to work in an animation studio like Cartoon Network or Disney, working on different animated TV series. It’s a goal that I still have in mind but I know that it isn’t the most realistic goal at this point with my current skill level. I have been practicing but I still don’t feel like I am a good enough artist to do character driven art and animation. Currently my skillset consists exclusively of physical art, although I have very minimal skills in Photoshop and After Effects. I don’t have too much practice with animation; the last one I completed was a year ago using Sketchbook Pro. I am looking forward to one of my future assignments in which I have to digitally draw assets for an animation class. Hopefully the assignment will get me back into the groove of drawing, as I have not been feeling very well about myself over the past couple of months. I’ve been meaning to look for internships but I currently do not have the time to go do a full time internship or job. Currently I’m still finishing my current required courses for my major. What I’m hoping for is that later on I can do more art like digital painting and sketching that will build upon what I really want to do. All I know right now is that I do not want to give up on doing art just yet. I want to continue drawing what comes to mind because it makes me really happy. Thank you for listening to me. 
<br>
I go by the name Someniam on other social media platforms where you can find more examples of my art. I wish I had a more formal ending so sorry about that.
