<p>Hello! My name is Puck Reverie! I go by the alias Someniam online. I enjoy various television programs and movies which as of the time I'm writing this (March 28, 2024) include OK K.O.! Let's be Heroes, Star Wars, South Park, Marvel, The Simpsons, Flatland and The Big Bang Theory. I am an artist who works using mainly traditional art mediums, but I am looking forward to creating more digital art. I've started to train my digital art skills now that I'm in college so that I can use those skills to create professional-grade artwork on the caliber of many artists I look up to. Speaking of what I would like to do after college, I intend to work for a major animation studio as either a concept artist or as an animator. For now I'm focusing on getting all of my work done so that I can get my Bachelor's Degree in Digital Media Art. Check out some of my works below! I hope you enjoy my content! </p>
