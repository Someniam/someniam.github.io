<h2 style="color:gray;">Artist/Writer</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Puck Reverie! I go by the alias Someniam online. I am an artist who works using mainly traditional art mediums, but I am looking forward to creating more digital art. I've started to train my digital art skills now that I'm in college so that I can use those skills to create professional-grade artwork on the caliber of many artists I look up to. Speaking of what I would like to do after college, I intend to work for a major animation studio as either a concept artist or as an animator. For now I'm focusing on getting all of my work done so that I can get my Bachelor's Degree in Digital Media Art.
