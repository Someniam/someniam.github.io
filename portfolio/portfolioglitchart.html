<p>These three art pieces are ones I have made by glitching the source images by opening them in programs that weren't meant for images. These images are all related to climate change and global warming. The meaning behind these was to show how humans are distorting and "glitching" the world beyond repair/recognition. The way I glitched these was that I exported them into programs like Audacity (audio program) and Notepad++ (text editor) then I exported the raw data and remade the images in Photoshop. I personally found it to be very interesting. </p>
