<p>The first step of this project was creating a 3D model in Minecraft. I built something (The Tech Museum of Innovation in downtown San Jose) out of Minecraft blocks and then I save the world and export it into a program called Mineways. After that I select my build in Mineways and export the data into another program called Flashpoint. I create the 3D model from Minecraft in Flashpoint, then export it into a file format that is meant for 3D printers to utilize so they can print. </p>

<p>This is a picture of my 3D prints. The first piece took twelve minutes to print out. The second, larger one took forty-two minutes to complete. The second print was a slightly more detailed version of the first build. I scaled both builds so that each block would equal about two millimeters in length, width and height. The third picture is after I had finished detailing the second print by sanding off some of the excess plastic and painting it. I mixed the primary colors of paint to get the right shade of blue and orange that match the colors of the real building it was based on. I chose to recreate the Tech Museum because it is a place that I have been going to since I was a child and I wanted to preserve it in case I ever leave San Jose. This project was very meaningful for me to do because it tied together multiple special interests of mine (painting, Minecraft and a place from my childhood) which is why I put in a lot of effort for this project.</p>
